This is source code of the project

To execute compiled version run "java -jar town-stars-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"

Hackathon_TownStar_Tuning.xlsx must be in the same directory of the project, it reads all the tuning settings from this xlsx.

It is possible to enhance the project using smart contracts: 
crafting, building and other actions can be checked via the contracts. Technology also can build chain of blocks (game actions), that are immutable.

Also, may be, it's possible to convert buildings, crafts to NFT, so then all the project can be run in the blockchain network.
